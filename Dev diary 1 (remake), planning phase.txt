Dev diary 1 (remake), planning phase

Hello, my name is Summer Wong and this is my dev diary for my planning phase (remake since my first got deleted). I've been enrolled in Code Ninjas since before it opened, so 4 years ago. My three favourite things about being a ninja is 1. Candy 2. Food 3. My friends. My game is Fruit Hunt, and it's an adventure and mystery game. The goal of the game is to collect different fruits that give codes. But here's the mystery; recently, the king Bob went missing. He seems to have gotten kidnapped, and we have to solve the mystery. We must talk to the first 3 tomatoes visible to get our lead, Prince Rob (or king Bob's brother). We must defeat him before we can save the kingdom. After defeating Rob, we must disarm a bomb in under a minute to save the kingdom. If you fail, you die and restart. It's a 2D game but the pixel models have a 3D effect on it, like shadows. I think most challenges I will face are about the health scripts
