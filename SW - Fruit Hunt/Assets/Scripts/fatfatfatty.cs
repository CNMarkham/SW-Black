// Y/N: Love you guys, bye!
// E/N: Bye!
// B: I know you voted for me, you fat, fat, fatty!
// Y/N: I don't even recognize you?!
// B: It's me...
// Y/N: ...
// B: From round one...?
// Y/N: Round one?! Girl we're almost at the finales!
// B: ...
// Y/N: You really stayed this long?
// B: Yeah...
// Y/N: ...
// B: Longer than your dad ever did!
// Y/N: Oh my god.
// B: Still, why would you vote for me?!
// Y/N: Girl what are you on about?
// B: I was the one who played Stacey!
// Y/N: No wonder you got voted out in round one...
// B: Excuse me?!
// Y/N: Nothing, but piece of advice: If you have the choice, don't pick Stacey.
// B: I'm inclusive, unlike you. No way!
// Y/N: Fine. It won't be my fault if you get voted out though!
// B: Oh, it will be.
