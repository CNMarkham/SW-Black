Plus the fact you're always being seeked for, hunted, in your case. Try finding your way out; it's nearly impossible to survive. This community used to be very loving and kind, but not anymore. Terror has rised and taken over. Your life is in danger, I hope you know. You can never run. Never hide. Never escape your mistakes. They're after you, and you'll be executed in cold blood; they don't care! I give you the advice to try to persuade them to let you live;

Let's see if you can figure out why your face looks that... obviously dumbfounded. You belong in a zoo looking like that, those eyebrows are unruly. You're damaging my eyes and you deserve to pay for my fixes! I can't stay like this forever, all because your stupid face! I'm not stopping, you cow. Why don't you produce some milk and send it to NoFrills huh? Your nose is shaped like a rock. Your earwax is yellow, and bulging out. Get it removed, bud! Ew, I can't even. Blegh.");

You look insane, and that's one thing I'm sure of. It's plastered across your face! Try something, you're blinding my soul and dignity. I recommend getting away, since I can tell you're trying to release a fart bomb. It's quite evident, visible too, on your perplexed face. Don't look so surprised I know, you know it yourself! Your face is green, are you okay? Just kidding, I would never care about you; especially when you look like that... I'm think I'm going to be sick.");
