If anyone needs this...

...Here's a few tips and tricks to help you with Unity.

A function is a set of instructions in a block of code. There are two types: one that gives back/returns, and one that doesn't. Most of them have parenthesis/brackets/()

strings are sentences,
floats are decimal numbers,
int(eger)s are non-decimal numbers,
bools are true/false.

*/asterisk means "times" or "multiply"

Two equal signs (==) means you are checking something, whilst one equal sign (=) means you are setting something to some value. :)

A coroutine is basically a function that lets you wait.

so, for loops are usually written like this...
for ( [variable type, name], [name] = [value], [name, expression])
{
	[rest of code.]
}

And if you're that clueless, here's one for if statements...
if ([code])
{
	[rest of code]
}

If you've made it here you're probably dumb...
